# Introduction
This lab looks at reliability testing of a program given failure data and a multitude of testing tools. In particular, we are looking at *reliability growth testing* and *reliability assesment using reliability demonstration chart*.

This lab also provides the opportunity to compare different reliability assessments to inspect the pros and cons of each and improve future decisions on tool usage.

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 

# Assessment Using Reliability Demonstration Chart 

# Comparison of Results

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
Team work was divided into pairs to practice pair programming. Part 1 was given to Jared and Jordan while part 2 was given to Liana and Amir.

Each pair worked on the reliability testing before coming together to compare results.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
