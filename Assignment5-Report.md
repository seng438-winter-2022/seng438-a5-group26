# 1. Introduction
This lab looks at reliability testing of a program given failure data and a multitude of testing tools. In particular, we are looking at *reliability growth testing* and *reliability assesment using reliability demonstration chart*.

This lab also provides the opportunity to compare different reliability assessments to inspect the pros and cons of each and improve future decisions on tool usage.

# 2. Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 

# 3. Assessment Using Reliability Demonstration Chart 

# 4. Comparison of Results

# 5. Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

# 6. How the team work/effort was divided and managed
Team work was divided into pairs to practice pair programming. Part 1 was given to Jared and Jordan while part 2 was given to Liana and Amir.

Each pair worked on the reliability testing before coming together to compare results.

# 7. Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned
In part 2, forming the charts was a little confusing when trying to find out which cells to modify and how to modify them so that the chart would appear properly. After some trial and error, we made it work.

# 8. Comments/feedback on the lab itself
